Reflexivity:

Let n be the number of divisors of x. n = n (obviously), so n <= n. So xRx always holds and R is reflexive.


Transitivity:

Let a be the number of divisors of x.
Let b be the number of divisors of y.
Let c be the number of divisors of z.

If xRy, then a <= b.
If yRz, then b <= c.
By the transitivity of <=, a <= c and thus xRz.


Quasi-ordering:
R is a quasi-ordering because R is reflexive and transitive.
