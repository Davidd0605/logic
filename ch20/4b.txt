In the exercise, they use a fancy symbol to denote the set containing all functions. I will simply refer to the set with 'functions' because my virtual character knowledge is... limited.

Does anyone have a more proper way to prove this?

(1) | var f; f is element of functions |
(2) |    | var x; x is element of R |
    |    |    { Property of function: }
(3) |    |    f(x) = f(x)
    |    |    { Mathematics: }
(4) |    |    -(f(x) < f(x))
(5) |    Universal quantifier for x[x is element of R : -(f(x) < f(x))]
    |    { R is not empty, so: }
(6) |    -(Universal quantifier for x[x is element of R : f(x) < f(x)])
    |    { Definition of < from assignment: }
(7) |    -(f < f)
(8) Universal quantifier for f[f is element of functions : -(f < f)]
    { Definition of irriflexivity: }
(9) < is irriflexive on functions
    { Fancy notation: }
(10) <( functions, < )>

ALTHOUGH I DID PROVE THAT THIS ORDERING IS IRREFLEXIVE, I DID NOT PROVE THAT IT IS AN IRREFLEXIVE ORDERING. I SHOULD HAVE PROVEN TRANSITIVITY AS WELL AND CONCLUDED STRICT ANTISYMMETRY.
