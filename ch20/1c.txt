In order to be a reflexive ordering, the ordering, must be reflextive, anitsymmetric and transitive.
I showed reflexivity and transitivity in b.

This ordering is not antisymmetric, I will give a counterexample.
3R7 holds because both 3 and 7 have 2 divisors, namely 1 and itself.
7R3 holds for the same reason.
(In order for xRy to hold, the number of divisors must be smaller than OR EQUAL).

This ordering is not antisymmetric, so this is no reflexive ordering.
