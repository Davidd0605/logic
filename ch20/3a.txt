(1) | var (a, b); (a, b) is element of A x B |
    |    { Property of x on (1): }
(2) |    a is element of A ^  b is element of B
    |    { Reflexivity of R1: }
(3) |    aR1a

    |    { Definition of R3: }
(6) |    (a, b)R3(a, b)
(7) Universal quantifier for (a, b)[(a, b) is element of A x B : (a, b)R3(a, b)]
    { Definition of reflexivity: }
(8) R3 is reflexive on A x B

ALTHOUGH I DID PROVE THAT R3 IS REFLEXIVE, I DID NOT PROVE THAT IT IS A REFLEXIVE ORDERING. I SHOULD HAVE PROVEN ANISYMMETRY AND TRANSITIVITY AS WELL. I MAY ADD PROOFS FOR THAT SOON, BUT NOT NOW.
