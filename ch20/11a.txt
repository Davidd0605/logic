The exercise suggests that I have to assume A' and A have a maximum, so I will...

(1) | Existensial quantifier for a[a is element of A : Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A : xRa]] ^ Existensial quantifier for a'[a' is element of A' : Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A' : xRa']] |
(2) | Existensial quantifier for a[a is element of A : Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A : xRa]]
(3) | Existensial quantifier for a'[a' is element of A' : Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A' : xRa']]
(4) | Pick a with a is element of A and Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A : xRa]
(5) | Pick a' with a' is element of A' and Universal quantifier for x[x is element of A' : xRa']
    | { A' is subset of A and property of subset on (5): }
(6) | a' is element of A
    | { Universal elimination on (4) and (6): }
(7) | a'Ra

I guess this is where my proof stops...
