No, many functions are incomparable.

A function f is smaller than a function g is f(x) < g(x) for every x.

I will give a simple example:

Let f(x) be x
Let g(x) be 1

f is not smaller than g because f(2) = 2 and g(2) = 1, (f(2) > g(2))
g is not smaller than f because f(0) = 0 and g(0) = 1, (g(0) > f(0))

So f is not smaller than g and f is not smaller than f.

So f and g are incomparable, so this can not be a linear ordering.
