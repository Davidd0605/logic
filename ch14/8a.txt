I am not even sure I understood the assignment correctly, so I am not very confident about this answer...

Start with the maths:

Solve: |x + 4| = 0
        x + 4  = 0
        x = -4

So the cases will be x <= -4 and x >= -4

Solve: |x + 4| >= 0.5x + 2
        x + 4 >= 0.5x + 2 v -x - 4 >= 0.5x + 2
        0.5x >= -2        v -1.5x >= 6
        x >= -4           v x <= -4

Take x >= -4 for P
Take x <= -4 for Q
Take |x + 4| >= 0.5x + 2 for R
