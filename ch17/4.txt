The googledrive answer of Daan de Graaf is equal to this one, but I find the last part hard to read.
The googledrive answer of Joris Rombouts is messy and seems incorrect.

(1) | Universal quantifier for x [x is element of V : Existensial quantifier for y [y is element of V : xRy]]
(2) |    | var a; a is element of V|
(3) |    |    Existensial quantifier for y [y is element of V : aRy]
(4) |    |    Pick b with b is element of V and aRb
(5) |    |    aRb
    |    |    { Symmetry on (5) : }
(6) |    |    bRa
    |    |    { Transitivity on (5) and (6) : }
(7) |    |    aRa
(8) |    Universal quantifier for x [x is element of V : xRx]
(9) |    R is reflexive
    |    { Given: }
(10)|    R is symmetric and R is transitive
(11)|    R is an equivalence relation
(12) Universal quantifier for x [x is element of V : Existensial quantifier for y [y is element of V : xRy]] --> R is an equivalence relation
