I couldn't find this exercise on the googledrive

Reflexive, symmetric and transitive

The explanation is not required for the assignment, but I added it because there were questions on whatsapp.

This is reflexive because xRx always holds. 
There are roughly 2 cases:
x is even
x is odd

xRx holds for x is even because 'even + even = even'
xRx holds for x is odd because 'odd + odd = even'

This is symmetric because xRy <--> yRx

When x + y is even (xRy), then y + x is even (yRx)

The explanation for transitive is a little more annoying:
When xRy, there are 2 cases:
x and y are both even
x and y are both odd

When x and y are both even and yRz
z must be even because yRz would not hold otherwise since y is even and z would be odd

When x and y are both odd and yRz
z must be odd because yRz would not hold otherwise since ys is odd and z would be even
