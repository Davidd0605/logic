# logic
My answers/solutions for the logical reasoning course. Use with care!

These are my answers for the logical reasoning course.

They should be used with care because:
-You learn much more from thinking yourself than from looking the answers up.
-I am just human, so my answers are not necessarily correct.

Bas Luttik explained in the e-mail why he thinks doing this is a bad idea. He is the expert, so there should be a large part of truth in that!

That being said, comparing your answers with mine is probably better than not checking your answers at all.
Please let me know if I made a mistake, so that this repository will be useful for me as well.

For the homework of week 3 to 8, you can use this link:

Sevda posted this link once in the app group.
The quality of the work varies a lot, but is often good.

The link contained a couple of answers provided by Luttik, check if the exercise you are looking for is in there! I put those answers in the file 'Some answers by Luttik.pdf'.

All assignments we have to make should be either in 'Some answers by Luttik', in the googledrive the link refers to or in this github repository.

The 'Soms answers by Luttik' only contains exercises from a few weeks ago, so that is no longer interesting.
When you are looking for an answer, first check the github. If it is in the github, this means that I think something is wrong with the answer on the googledrive. Sometimes, I write the reason at the top of the file in github.
If we have to do the exercise and it's not in the github, this means that I think the answer on googledrive is correct.
