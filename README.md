# logic
My answers/solutions for the logical reasoning course. Use with care!

These are my answers for the logical reasoning course.

They should be used with care because:
-You learn much more from thinking yourself than from looking the answers up.
-I am just human, so my answers are not necessarily correct.

Bas Luttik explained in the e-mail why he thinks doing this is a bad idea. He is the expert, so there should be a large part of truth in that!

However, comparing your answers with mine is probably better than not checking your answers at all.
Please let me know if I made a mistake, so that this repository will be useful for me as well.
