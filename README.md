My answers/solutions for the logical reasoning course. Use with care!

## About the answers
These are student answers (most of them written by me) for the logical reasoning course.

They should be used with care because:
 - You learn much more from thinking yourself than from looking the answers up.
 - I am just human, so my answers are not necessarily correct.

Bas Luttik explained in the e-mail why he thinks doing this is a bad idea. He is the expert, so there should be a large part of truth in that!

That being said, comparing your answers with mine is probably better than not checking your answers at all.
Please let me know if I made a mistake, so that I can correct it and no-one else encounters wrong answers.

There are a couple of answers provided by Luttik, check if the exercise you are looking for is in there! I put those answers in the file 'Some answers by Luttik.pdf'.

## Missing some answers
Originally, this repository referred to a *Google Drive* that contained answers to a part of the exercises. This repository contains the rest of the exercises. Unfortunately, that drive seems to have been removed, so **some answers are missing**.

Unfortunately, it is a long time ago I took this course myself and I can't find my own answers to these questions anymore (and I'm not planning to retake this course just to repair this repository). Thus, I need pull requests from other students to fill the missing answers.
