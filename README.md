# logic
My answers/solutions for the logical reasoning course. Use with care!

These are my answers for the logical reasoning course.

They should be used with care because:
 - You learn much more from thinking yourself than from looking the answers up.
 - I am just human, so my answers are not necessarily correct.

Bas Luttik explained in the e-mail why he thinks doing this is a bad idea. He is the expert, so there should be a large part of truth in that!

That being said, comparing your answers with mine is probably better than not checking your answers at all.
Please let me know if I made a mistake, so that this repository will be useful for me as well.

**The Google Drive seems to have been removed, so some answers are currently missing.**

There are a couple of answers provided by Luttik, check if the exercise you are looking for is in there! I put those answers in the file 'Some answers by Luttik.pdf'.

All assignments we have to make should be either in 'Some answers by Luttik' or this github repository. **Unfortunately, answers to some questions are currently missing because the old Google Drive was removed.**
