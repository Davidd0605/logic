I think the answers on google drive are a bit weird because they assume things that are given.
Also, the difference between x and x' can be hard to read on the pictures.

| var y; True |
|    | y is element of f(S intersection T) |
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    Existensial quantifier for x [x is element of S intersection T : f(x) = y]
|    |    Pick x with x is element of S intersection T and f(x) = y
|    |    { Property of intersection: }
|    |    x is element of S ^ x is element of T
|    |    x is element of S
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    f(x) is element of f(S)
|    |    x is element of T
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    f(x) is element of f(T)
|    |    { Property of intersection: }
|    |    f(x) is element of f(S) intersection f(T)
|    |    { y = f(x)}
|    |    y is element of f(S) intersection f(T)
|    y is element of f(S intersection T) --> y is element of f(S) intersection f(T)
|    | y is element of f(S) intersection f(T) |
|    |    { Property of intersection: }
|    |    y is element of f(S) ^ y is element of f(T)
|    |    y is element of f(S)
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    Existensial quantifier for x[x is element of S : f(x) = y]
|    |    Pick x with x is element of S and f(x) = y
|    |    y is element of f(T)
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    Existensial quantifier for z[z is element of T : f(z) = y]
|    |    Pick z with z is element of T and f(z) = y
|    |    { Property of injection: }
|    |    Universal quantifier for a,b[a,b are elements of A : (f(a) = f(b)) --> a = b]
|    |    f(x) = f(z) --> x = z
|    |    { f(x) = y and f(z) = y}
|    |    x = z
|    |    { x = z and z is element of T}
|    |    x is element of T
|    |    x is element of S ^ x is element of T
|    |    { Property of intersection: }
|    |    x is element of S intersection T
|    |    { Property of image: }
|    |    f(x) is element of f(S intersection T)
|    |    { f(x) = y }
|    |    y is element of f(S intersection T)
|    y is element of f(S) intersection f(T) --> y is element of f(S intersection T)
|    y is element of f(S intersection T) <--> y is element of f(S) intersection f(T)
|    { Property of =: }
|    f(S intersection T) = f(S) intersection f(T)
Universal quantifier for y[True : f(S intersection T) = f(S) intersection f(T)]
f(S intersection T) = f(S) intersection f(T)
