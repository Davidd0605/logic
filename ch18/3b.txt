The answers of Daan de Graaff on googledrive seem incorrect and use confusing variable names

(1) | var y; y is element of f(S intersection T) |
    |    { Property of image on (1) : }
(2) |    Existensial quantifier for x[x is element of S intersection T : y = f(x)]
(3) |    Pick x with x is element of S intersection T and y = f(x)
    |    { Property of intersection on (3) : }
(4) |    x is element of S ^ x is element of T
(5) |    x is element of S
    |    { Property of image on (5) : }
(6) |    f(x) is element of f(S)
    |    { y = f(x) }
(7) |    y is element of f(S)
(8) |    x is element of T
    |    { Property of image on (8): }
(9) |    f(x) is element of f(T)
    |    { y is f(x) }
(10)|    y is element of f(T)
(11)|    y is element of f(S) ^ y is element of f(T)
    |    { Property of intersection on (11) : }
(12)|    y is element of f(S) intersection f(T)
(13) Universal quantifier for y[y is element of f(S intersection T) : y is element of f(S) intersection f(T)]
{ Property of subset on (13) : }
(14) f(S intersection T) is subset of f(S) intersection f(T)
