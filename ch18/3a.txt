The answer on the googledrive took annoying variable names and the last part seems incorrect.

(1) | S is subset of T |
(2) |    | var y; y is element of f(S) |
    |    | { Property of image on (2) : }
(3) |    | Existensial quantifier for x[x is element of S : f(x) = y]
(4) |    | Pick x with x is element of S and f(x) = y
(5) |    | x is element of S
    |    | { Property of subset on (5) : }
(6) |    | x is element of T
    |    | { Property of image on (6): }
(7) |    | f(x) is element of f(T)
    |    | { f(x) = y }
(8) |    | y is element of f(T)
(9) | Universal quantifier for y [y is element of f(S) : y is element of f(T)]
    | { Property of subset: }
(10)| f(S) is subset of f(T)
(11) S is subset of T --> f(S) is subset of f(T)
