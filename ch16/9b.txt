Let A be {1}
Let B be {1}
Let C be {2}

Then A\B is the empty set
And A union B is {1}
And B intersection C is the empty set

Insert in proposition:

A\B = empty set --> A union B = B intersection C
empty set = empty set --> {1} = empty set
True --> False
False

So this proposition does not always hold.
