a) The amount of classes is equal to 2 to the power of n
where n is the number of variables. There can be infinite variables, so there are 2 to the power of infinity (which is also infinity) classes.

b) Let P be a proposition of the class. Then P V False is a proposition as well and so is P V False V False
I can keep adding propositions this way...
