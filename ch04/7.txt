For the tautology part:

Show that (a=>a) is a tautology. (1)
Show that a=>(a=>a) is also a tautology and therefore equivalant to (a=>a). (2)
Concluding, (1) and (2) show that any number of a's implying (a=>a) is equivalant to (a=>a) and therefore always a tautology. (4)


For the contingency part:

Show that (a=>a)=>a is a contingency and equivalant to a. (3)
Concluding, (1) and (3) show that any number of a's being implied by (a=>a) is equivalant to a and therefore always a contingency. (5)


Combining both parts:

Lastly, (4) and (5) show that every abstract proposition built only from a and => is either a tautology or a contingency.
