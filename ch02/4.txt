I am not sure I understood this exercise

a) If a and b are abstract propositions, then so is b --> a. If a and b--> a are abstract propositions, then so is a --> (b --> a)
b) If b is an abstract proposition, then so is -b
If a and -b are abstract propositions, then so is a ^ -b
If a and b are abstract propositions, then so is a --> b
If a --> b is an abstract proposition, then so is -(a --> b)
If -(a --> b) and a ^ -b are abstract propositions, then so is -(a --> b) <--> a ^ -b
